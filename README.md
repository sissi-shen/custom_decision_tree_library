I built fromn sratch both classification and regression decision trees with fit and predict methods. This helped me truly understand the inner workings of how a decision tree decides to segment the data, and reveal how flexible and powerful tree-based models can be.

I implemented the following classes and functions:

• DecisionTree621: should contain fit, fit_, and predict methods
• RegressionTree621: should contain score and create_leaf methods, and inherit the
fit and predict methods from DecisionTree621
• ClassifierTree621: should contain score and create_leaf methods, and inherit the
fit and predict methods from DecisionTree621
